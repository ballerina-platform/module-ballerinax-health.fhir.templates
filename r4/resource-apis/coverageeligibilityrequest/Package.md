## Prerequisites

Pull the template from central

    ` bal new -t ballerinax/health.fhir.templates.international401.coverageeligibilityrequest CoverageEligibilityRequestAPI `

## Run the template
- Run the Ballerina project created by the service template by executing bal run from the root.
- Once successfully executed, Listener will be started at port 9090. Then you need to invoke the service using the following curl command
    ` $ curl http://localhost:9090/fhir/r4/CoverageEligibilityRequest `
- Now service will be invoked and returns an Operation Outcome, until the code template is implemented completely.

## Adding a Custom Profile/Combination of Profiles

- Add profile type to the aggregated resource type. Eg: `public type CoverageEligibilityRequest r4:CoverageEligibilityRequest|<Other_CoverageEligibilityRequest_Profile>;`.
    - Add the new profile URL in `api_config.bal` file.
    - Add as a string inside the `profiles` array.
    - Eg: `profiles: ["http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/CoverageEligibilityRequest", "new_profile_url"]`
